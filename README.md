A PHP and MongoDB based CMS for developers that delivers data via APIs and services only.

## Overview

Mongolium is broken down into four basic layers.

- **Controllers:** manages restful requests, interacts with the services layer and returns JSON for the API.
- **Services:** core business logic, provides application interfaces for .
- **Models:** strongly defined value objects / entities that provide structure to the Mongo objects and collections.
- **ORM:** responsible for hydrating the model entities with data returned from Mongo before passing them back to the services layer.
